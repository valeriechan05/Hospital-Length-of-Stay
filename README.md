# Hospital-Length-of-Stay
This project aims to optimize a ML algorithm to predict patients' length of stay (LOS) in hospitals, which can potentially provide insights on bed and medical resources allocation. The dataset can be found on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nehaprabhavalkar/av-healthcare-analytics-ii).
It is still in progress and is continually updated, and will be finalized by 12/6/2022.

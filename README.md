# Hospital-Length-of-Stay
This project aims to optimize a ML algorithm to predict patients' length of stay (LOS) in hospitals, which can potentially provide insights on bed and medical resources allocation. The dataset can be found on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nehaprabhavalkar/av-healthcare-analytics-ii).
It is still in progress as we plan on using more feature engineering techniques to improve the predictability. Please refer to the lastest version of the file and let me know if you have any suggestions!
